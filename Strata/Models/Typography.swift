// MARK: - Jaro

// Jaro is no longer a runtime font, and `JaroFont` is gone with the wordmark
// that used it (2026-09-09, owner's call — beside the block-S mark it read as
// a heavy angular slab next to five pale rounded blocks). It was also briefly
// on the tally numeral, which made the one number on each screen look like
// part of the logo rather than a count of your day.
//
// `Strata/Resources/Jaro.ttf` still ships and must stay: the app icon and
// `StrataMark` are its S taken apart at the glyph's own inner corners, and
// `tools/make_app_icon.py` reads the file to regenerate both. `Jaro-OFL.txt`
// stays beside it, which is what the SIL Open Font License requires.
//
// So Jaro supplies GEOMETRY now, not type. Do not reintroduce it as a face.
